    "# Overview\n",
    "The data structure of this repository is organized within a primary directory named `data`. This directory contains three subdirectories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `/raw`: Contains the raw text data of papers. This can be sourced from OpenAlex, a custom dataset, or other sources.\n",
    "- `/processed`: Contains processed versions of the papers. Papers are sorted by publication date (according to OpenAlex). Two specific files are expected here:\n",
    "    - `papers_words.csv`\n",
    "    - `papers_phrases.csv`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Each of the processed files should have the following three columns:\n",
    "    - *`PaperID`*\n",
    "    - *`Title_Words`* (or `Title_Phrases` for noun phrases)\n",
    "    - *`Abstract_Words`* (or `Abstract_Phrases` for noun phrases)\n",
    "    \n",
    "> **_NOTE 1:_**  All papers MUST be sorted by publication date.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **_NOTE 2:_** Nan (`np.nan`) are placed where the abstract is unavailable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Selection Guide: *Choosing the Dataset*\n",
    "This repository is based on OpenAlex data. The data output is available at [https://zenodo.org/record/13869486](https://zenodo.org/record/13869486), that provides data on all text data from OpenAlex papers published between 1666 and 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the underlying code remains consistent, users might have different data requirements. Some may prefer a custom dataset. This notebook outlines four distinct approaches to data acquisition.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Approach 1**: Use custom data\n",
    "- **Approach 2**: Use OpenAlex data\n",
    "- **Approach 3**: Use a subset of Zenodo (OpenAlex papers) data\n",
    "- **Approach 4**. Use the entire Zenodo (OpenAlex papers) data\n",
    "\n",
    "Please contact Nicola Melluso for any suggestions or feedback."
