    "# New word comb\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook is designed for analyzing a dataset of papers to identify and count the occurrence of new word combinations. The baseline is constructed from papers published before a specified year. The script reads processed data from a CSV file, compares each word combinations against the baseline, and counts the occurrences of new word combinations. The results are then written to a new CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "- **Setting Up the Environment**: The script starts by importing necessary libraries and adjusting the system’s maximum integer size to avoid errors when reading large lines from the CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Counting the Number of Papers:** It calculates the total number of papers to be processed by counting the lines in the processed data CSV file. This is needed to keep track of the process with a progress bar (tqdm).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Creating the Baseline:** A baseline set of word combinations is created from papers published before a specified baseline year. The notebook reads each paper and adds word combinations to the baseline set if the paper’s publication year is before the baseline year.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Counting New Words:** The notebook then reads the processed data of each paper and counts the occurrence of word combinations that are not in the baseline set. Each new word combination’s count and the ID of the paper in which it first appeared are stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exporting the Results:** The counted new word combinations, along with the ID of the paper in which each word combination first appeared and the total count of each word combinations’s occurrence, are written to a new CSV file. Word combinations that only appeared once are filtered out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "The notebook generates a CSV file containing each new word combination that is not part of the baseline, the ID of the paper in which the word combinations first appeared, and the total count of the word combination’s occurrence in all papers. Each row in the file represents a unique new word combination."
